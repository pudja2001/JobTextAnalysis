# JobTextAnalysis

This Project is made by myself to learn web scraping, EDA, doing text cleaning, and how to deploy the visualization to web by using Heroku and Streamlit. Currently doing some topic modelling on the text data to gain more insight about data field.

You can look the website here : https://job-text-analysis.herokuapp.com/. 

**Note** : if the website is error, you can run `streamlit run web_deploy.py` on your terminal. Make sure the libraries on your local have same versions with the versions on requirement.txt file.
